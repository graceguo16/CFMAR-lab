## Abstract

This study proposes a hybrid volatility forecasting framework that integrates classical GARCH-type models with a Time-based Mixture of Experts (Time-MoE) neural network to improve one-day-ahead Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation for crude oil returns. The model combines forecasts from standard GARCH, exponential GARCH (eGARCH), and threshold GARCH (tGARCH) specifications with a Mixture of Experts architecture designed to dynamically weight model contributions across different market regimes. By leveraging both econometric structure and nonlinear deep learning representations, the hybrid approach captures volatility clustering, leverage effects, and structural breaks more effectively than standalone models.

We evaluate the framework using daily log returns of crude oil prices obtained from the public GitHub repository *oil-prices*, focusing on two periods of extreme market stress: the 2007–09 Financial Crisis and the 2020–21 COVID-19 recession. One-day-ahead 95% and 99% VaR forecasts are generated using both Parametric (PAR) and Filtered Historical Simulation (FHS) methods. Forecast performance is assessed relative to traditional VaR approaches, including Historical Simulation, Bootstrap, age-weighted methods, and volatility-based models using GARCH, LSTM, and BiLSTM forecasts. Evaluation is conducted using unconditional and conditional coverage tests alongside regulatory and firm-oriented loss functions. Results indicate that the GARCH–Time-MoE hybrid model delivers improved tail-risk accuracy and more stable coverage performance during periods of heightened volatility, highlighting the benefits of combining structured econometric models with adaptive deep learning architectures for financial risk management.
